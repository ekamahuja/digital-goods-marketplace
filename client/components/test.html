      The upgrade process is extremely simple and almost self-explanatory. Your email, key (the product sent via email after payment), and a working Internet connection is all you need. After you enter the details and click “Upgrade”, the entire process may take up to 1 minute depending on website traffic. If you have any problems or fail to receive an upgrade after clicking “Upgrade”, please contact 
      <a href="/discord" target="_tab">support</a>.

      How can you guarantee a “Lifetime” subscription for so cheap?
  </p>
  <p>
      We operate on the economic concept: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale" target="_tab">economies of scale</a>.

      How long will the Premium last?
  </p>
  <p>
      In most cases, your plan will last for months/years. However, if the Premium doesn’t last as long as expected, with our Lifetime & Unlimited Replacements guarantee, you may easily get back on your Premium plan in seconds by visiting our <a href="/repalcement" target="_tab">replacement system</a> to claim an automatic replacement. Since the start of our service, we have many longtime customers dating back to the start of our service in 2016 that have continued to enjoy streaming music on their Family Plan.
